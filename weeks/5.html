    <h1>Week 5: 3D Design, Printing, & Scanning</h1>

    <p>This week, we learned how to design 3D objects and print them using a 3D printer. We also started looking into scanning objects as a way to build 3D designs. The assignment this week had three parts, which are included below.</p>

    <h2>Part 1: 3D Printed Flower.</h2>

    <h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>I wanted to design and print something more artistic than functional, and something that I know I couldn't make myself. At first I was considering making a lampshade, but then decided that would be too large and take too much material, so I tried to make mini-lampshade / flower shape. </p>

    <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>I began by watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnKBSOulwo">tutorial</a> on how to make a lamp in Fusion360, since I wanted to know how you could create a pattern on the outside of a surface that is neither flat nor a perfect cylinder. I learned a few new techniques like using "revolve" to turn a flat sketch into a round 3D object, and how to take the intersection of an existing object and the extrusion of a sketch. Below are some pictures of the design process in Fusion360</p>

    <div class="container">

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>You can also see a 3D version of the final design below</p>

    <p>TODO</p>

    <p>Next, I opened the design in the slicer and added some supports, and started printing!</p>

    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="../images/week5/supported_slice.png" alt="support">

    <p>Finally, I spent around half an hour scraping the support material off of the design itself</p>

    <img class="img-thumbnail half" src="../images/week5/scrape.JPG" alt="support">

    <h3>The Product</h3>

    I was pretty happy with the final product! It ended up looking a little more like some squid-like creature than a flower, but I think it's a pretty cool design. I chipped off one of the ends a bit while scraping and sanding, but other than that it came out well!

    <h2>Part 2: 3D Scanning</h2>

    <p>Per Nathan's Slack message, the RevoPoint scanner is not currently working, so I was unable to scan an object. I will work on this at some other point!</p>
