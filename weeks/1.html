    <h1>Week 1: Project Ideas</h1>

    <p>i don't have any super concrete ideas for my project yet, i'm hoping to refine these as the semester goes on, but here are a couple of ideas i have so far</p>

    <h3>Knee-Related Ideas</h3>

    

    <p>i tore my patellar tendon, acl, and meniscus last semester, so i've been thinking about something that could help me (and maybe others) in the recovery process. one idea i've had is a motion-tracking device that can help people see whether they're doing their pt exercises correctly. another potential idea along these lines would be something to help people who just had surgery with a simple everyday task (i couldn't put my own socks on for more than a month). </p>

    <h3>Education-Related Ideas</h3>
    <p>
        i've been involved in computer science education for around five years now, and i'd be interested in the idea of making a device that kids could program to make learning cs more physical. it would be cool to allow kids to actually move physical blocks around to make a device move and get excited about programming without just looking at a computer screen.
    </p>

    <h1>Week 4 Update: Background Research</h1>

    <p>While I still could change my mind, right now I'm starting to research the idea of making a kit that will help kids learn to code by physically dragging code blocks around. Here's what I found in my research while looking forr similar things that already exist:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>: This is what gave me the idea, and it is very useful as it allows kids to drag and drop colorful pieces that control varrious "sprites" on the screen. I think this would be even more compelling for kids if it was done in the physical space.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.letsstartcoding.com/ultimate-kit-2-product-detail">Lets Start Coding Kits</a>: These kits allow kids to practice programming, then send their programs to a circuit they've made, similarly to what we're doing with microcontrollers. While the results are physical, the coding itself actually takes place on a computer. These kits cost around $170, so it would be nice to make it cheaper.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.primotoys.com/">Cubetto</a>: This toy seems to be the most similar to what I want to accomplish, as kids put code pins into a physical board rather than typing it out. I would hope that my project though could include some concepts like loops and conditionals not on display here, and that I could put something together for less than the price here of $180</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In general, it might not be possible to do everything I hope to (conditionals, functions, loops, etc), but I hope to do something with at least some aspects of programming built out, with some input sensors (maybe a remote control?) and keep it at a much lower cost than the existing options offer.</p>



    <h1 id="week5update">Week 5 Update</h1>

    <h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wooden board on which code pieces would be placed.</li>
      <li>Individual code pieces likely laser cut out of vinyl</li>
      <li>Metal connectors for the pieces so we can somehow detect which pieces are where.</li>
      <li>For output, I would love to make a small vehicle that would drive around as programmed. I know I would need some small motors for this, a power supply, and a material to build the vehicle, but I haven't done much playing around with this.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In the coming weeks, get a vehicle working that accepts commands and can turn, stop, go, and change speeds.</li>
      <li>Afterward, get a basic connection between the code blocks and the car. This might look like just "stop" and "go" blocks that would control it remotely.</li>
      <li>Start building out more complicated code blocks and implementing them. These could be conditionals, functions, loops, etc.</li>
      <li>Consider other input/output sources. Should the vehicle change colors? Should it detect certain things like walls or spots on the ground?</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Project Plan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3D print the chasis of the car. This will hopefully allow the parts to fit together smoothly so I won't have to worry about the wheels or other parts getting stuck.</li>
      <li>I'll have to use some remote control technology we haven't learned yet to allow the car to take commands based on what code is arranged by the user. </li>
      <li>I think I'll laser cut the code blocks, and use hand tools to make a board where they'll be arranged. I'll have to think of some circuitry magic that will allow multiple blocks of varying lengths to come together and allow the program to recognize which of the blocks are where.</li>
      <li>I'm not sure where the driving force of the program will be located. In the vehicle? In the code blocks? It might be useful to have 1 main start block that contains the code and that all others will attach to.</li>
    </ul>
